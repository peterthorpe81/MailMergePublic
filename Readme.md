</p>

## üóÇÔ∏è Tech:
<p align="left">
I wanted to demonstrate what can be done with Blazor WASM and some of the great tools available for it. The project outside of the API calls is a static site (no backend).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>MudBlazor component libary has been used for the UI which is great for blazor development</li>
  <li>CKEditor as the HTML body editor. This is wrapped in a component that handles the JS Interop back and forth</li>
  <li>The OneDrive file picker has been used. This is also wrapped in a component to handle the JS Interop</li>
  <li>Graph has been used to select and process an excel table</li>
  <li>Graph has been used to send emails in bulk mail merged with the excel data</li>
</ul>

## üì• Installation & Set Up
<p> Clone the repo and create an App Registration in Azure Active Directory. It will need the permissions User.Read,Mail.Send,Files.Read,Files.Read.All,Sites.Read.All. It will also need Access Tokens/ID Tokens selecting alogn with a relevant rspa redirect url.</p>
<p> Set your Client ID in appsettings.Json</p>

## TODO
<p>I ran out of time as I only saw this 2 days before the hackathon closed</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve the documentation here and instructions on the site</li>
  <li>Look into batching the emails to save on graph calls and throttling</li>
  <li><strike>Expose exceptions where the selected Excel data isn't valid to the user or sending fails</strike></li>
  <li><strike>General UI improvements such as progress of sending the emails</strike></li>
  <li><strike>Change body text field to a HTML editor such as TinyMCE</strike> I have wrapped CKEditor</li>
</ul>
